            ## About Employee Attrition
            Employee attrition refers to the gradual loss of employees over time. 
            High attrition rates can indicate dissatisfaction or issues within the 
            organization. Understanding the reasons behind attrition can help 
            organizations improve retention strategies.

            to foster a more stable workforce.
