            - **Data Analysis:** View summary statistics, visualize patterns, and understand key factors.
            - **Prediction:** Input new employee data to predict the likelihood of attrition.
            - **Results:** Review the predictions and take data-driven actions.
            
            ## About Employee Attrition
            Employee attrition refers to the gradual loss of employees over time. 
            High attrition rates can indicate dissatisfaction or issues within the 
            organization. Understanding the reasons behind attrition can help 
            organizations improve retention strategies.
            
            Use this app to identify at-risk employees and make informed decisions 
            to foster a more stable workforce.
